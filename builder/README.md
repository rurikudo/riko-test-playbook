# Examples of Ansible Builder

- [ansible/ansible-builder](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder)
- [Introduction â€” ansible-builder documentation](https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Environment in This Example

- CentOS 8.2
- Python 3.9
- Docker 20.10.7

## Install

```bash
python3 -m pip install ansible-builder
```

## Prepare Required Files

`execution-environment.yml` is required file to build Execution Environment.

The base image can be chosen from the tags from [http://quay.io/ansible/ansible-runner](https://quay.io/repository/ansible/ansible-runner?tab=tags).

## Build Execution Environment

`ansible-builder build` command builds Execution Environment as a container image according to the definition in `execution-environment.yml`.

```bash
cd builder
ansible-builder build --tag registry.example.com/ansible/ee:2.10-custom --container-runtime docker --verbosity 3
```

```bash
$ ansible-builder build --tag registry.example.com/ansible/ee:2.10-custom --container-runtime docker --verbosity 3
Ansible Builder is building your execution environment image, "registry.example.com/ansible/ee:2.10-custom".
File context/_build/requirements.yml will be created.
File context/_build/requirements.txt will be created.
File context/_build/bindep.txt will be created.
File context/_build/ansible.cfg will be created.

Complete! The build context can be found at: /home/********/awx-on-k3s/builder/context
```

```bash
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                              TAG                 IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
registry.example.com/ansible/ee         2.10-custom         6fb343319a80   2 minutes ago   871MB
```

Now you can push this image to your [private container registry](../registry/README.md) to use as Execution Environment on AWX.

```bash
$ docker push registry.example.com/ansible/ee:2.10-custom
The push refers to repository [registry.example.com/ansible/ee]
...
2.10-custom: digest: sha256:0138445c58253c733f2e255b618469d9f61337901c13e3be6412984fd835ad55 size: 3880
```

The `Dockerfile` generated for the build will be saved under the `context` directory.

```bash
$ cat context/Dockerfile
ARG EE_BASE_IMAGE=quay.io/ansible/ansible-runner:stable-2.10-devel
ARG EE_BUILDER_IMAGE=quay.io/ansible/ansible-builder:latest

FROM $EE_BASE_IMAGE as galaxy
ARG ANSIBLE_GALAXY_CLI_COLLECTION_OPTS=
USER root
...
```

## Create Context Files

`ansible-builder create` command only creates context files like `Dockerfile`, it does not invoke building the image.

```bash
$ ansible-builder create --verbosity 3
Ansible Builder is generating your execution environment build context.
File context/_build/requirements.yml will be created.
File context/_build/requirements.txt will be created.
File context/_build/bindep.txt will be created.
File context/_build/ansible.cfg will be created.
